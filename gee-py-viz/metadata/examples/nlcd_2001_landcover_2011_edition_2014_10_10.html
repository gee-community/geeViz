The information on data quality for the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition was generated by the Decision Tree algorithm that conducts a cross-validation for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  No formal independent accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover has been made.  The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for land cover predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design.  For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size.  For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples).  This process was repeated 5 times.  After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs were computed.  Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment.  This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered &quot;provisional&quot; until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

The value above represents the overall accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 1.0 layer at Anderson Level II as reported in the following manuscript:  Wickham, J. D., Stehman S. V., Fry, J.

An accuracy assessment of the revised portions of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition layer has not been completed and those areas are considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment has been completed.

Process Step for NLCD 2001 Original Version:
The land cover classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993).  C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation.  Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality.  In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system.
To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover, training data were collected from several combined sources.
Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed).  All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method.
Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product.  The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section).  The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness &lt; 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness &gt; 79%).  Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product.  Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an &quot;area of interest&quot; (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI.
The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a &quot;smart eliminate&quot; algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition):
To improve NLCD imperviousness, the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products.  This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern half of the conterminous United States.  High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP &ndash; <a href="http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/">http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/</a>) imagery was used to verify imperviousness.  Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed.  A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era.  These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.

Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 edition, amended 2014):
The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values.  However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel.  This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes.  The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing.  Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area.  Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.
