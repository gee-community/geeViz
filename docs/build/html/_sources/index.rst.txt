     * Data filtering and manipulation
     * Data analysis and visualization
     * Creating and managing maps
* geeViz works inside and outside Python notebook environments, providing a flexible method for visualizing data in GEE using Python

* Check out the :doc:`installation` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the package. 

* Check out the :doc:`examples` section for examples showing uses of geeViz. 

* :class:`geeViz.geeView.mapper` is based on the `Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) Viewer framework <https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer/>`_. It leverages the same code the LCMS viewer uses, providing the ability to easily view and explore GEE objects in a map environment.
