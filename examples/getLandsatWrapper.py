# If using wrapping and the majority of the days occur in the second year, the system:time_start will default

# startJulian: Starting Julian date
# endJulian: Ending Julian date

# For example- if timeBuffer is 1, that is a 3 year moving window
# If the center year is 2000, then the years are 1999,2000, and 2001
# In order to overweight the center year, you could specify the weights as
# [1,5,1] which would duplicate the center year 5 times and increase its weight for
# the compositing method. If timeBuffer = 0, set to [1]

# Choose medoid or median compositing method.

# CloudScore runs pretty quickly, but does look at the time series to find areas that
# always have a high cloudScore to reduce commission errors- this takes some time
